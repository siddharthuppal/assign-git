For a Java Project it contains file extensions like .class, .log, *.ctxt, .mtj.tmp/, 
different types of Package Files(*.rar, *.zip, etc) and .project files specific to the IDE used.

Q2.What does fast-forward in Git mean?
- Fast-forward in git means when we merge 2 branches (usually one master) and they are not divergent 
and hence merge without a conflict.

Q3.Why should you have different branches?
- You should have different brances so that different functionality can be added on simultaniously on
the coppies of the project and later be merged into the final project(branch).

Q4.In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
- In a project you usually have 1 remote repositories which is worked on by many developers. But if 
the project size is big or has many components(APIs, Website, etc) it makes sense to make multiple repos.
